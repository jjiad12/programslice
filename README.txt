Static analysis tool for python programs.

An educational project of mine. The goal is to be able to slice
programs. Given a statement, I'd like to forward, or backward slice a
python program and see what statements are affected by the given
statement. More information can be found here:

I'm not sure how I go with this, as it is new territory for me.

This work would not be possible without:

    * Ned Batchelders code complexity micro tool. I've studied his
      program and taken a few implementation ideas on board. Thank you
      very much for this.
