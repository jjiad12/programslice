Slicing Forward
===============

For example, you're currently writing a very simple python program in
your current vim session:

>>> program = """
... def main():
...     foo = 1
...     bar = 1
...     baz = foo + bar
...     print baz
... 
... if __name__ == "__main__":
...     main()
... """

Suppose you want to see which variables depend on the variable ``foo`` in
line 3, you'd hand your buffer over to the utility function and slice it
for line 3:

>>> from programslice import slice_vim_buffer
>>> slice_vim_buffer(3, program, 'myprogram')
[3, 5, 6]

This tells us, that line 3 is depended on lines 5 and 6 or in other
words 4 does not interfere with line 3 at all and can be ignored.

Inverted Result
---------------

If we want to see all lines which are **not depending** on line 3:

>>> slice_vim_buffer(3, program, 'mypogram', invert=True)
[4]

Shebangs and Encoding declarations
==================================

Sometimes programs use encoding declarations, which need to removed
before the program can be parsed. The slicing will happen nevertheless:

>>> program = u'#!/usr/bin/env python\n# coding: utf-8\n{program}'.format(program=program)
>>> slice_vim_buffer(4, program, 'myprogram')
[4, 6, 7]
